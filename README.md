Some facts about me 

  

## Skills 

  

#### Detail oriented 

  

My experience as a Software Quality Assurance has trained me to pay high attention on details. The Maintenance Assessment Scoring System (MASS) Project I used to work on involved massive processed data and logics on mathematics for me to comprehend; I have developed a fine sense to spot errors and bugs when it comes to testing and coding. 

  

#### Fast learner 

  

I was placed into an important government project even with no previous experience on computing and coding by showing initiative on learning. I quickly picked up SQL and HTML along with the assigned tasks. I also promptly gained understandings on users' work flow and work habit to make sure the project would be delivered with high quality. 

  

#### Team-player 

  

I possess strong commitment to team environment dynamics with the ability to make contribution. It was an essential task for me to deliver the users' requirements to the developers precisely and communicate with my teammates and leader effectively during the development process.
