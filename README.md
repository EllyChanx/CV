Some facts about me

## Skills

#### Detail orianted

My experience as a Software Quality Assurance has trained me to pay high attention on details. The Maintenance Assessment Scoring System (MASS) Project I used to worked on involved massive processed data and logics on mathematics for me to comprehend; I have developed a fine sense to spot errors and bugs when it comes to testing and coding.

#### Fast learner

I was placed into an important govemental project even with no previous experience on computing and coding by showing initiative on learning. I quickly picked up SQL and HTML along with the assigned tasks. I also promptly gained understandings on users' work flow and work habit to make sure the project would be delivered with high quality.
