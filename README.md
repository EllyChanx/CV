## Skills 

#### Technologies

- Javascript, Node.js, Express, ReactJS, jQuery, Jasmine, TestCafe
- Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Rspec, Capybara, Sinatra
- HTML, CSS
- SQL

#### Detail oriented 

My experience as a Software QA has trained me to pay high attention to details. The Maintenance Assessment Scoring System (MASS) Project I used to work on involved massive processed data and logic on mathematics for me to comprehend; I have developed a fine sense to spot errors and bugs when it comes to testing and coding. 

#### Fast learner 

I quickly picked up SQL and HTML along with the assigned tasks while I was working as a Software QA. As a student in Makers, I demonstrated the ability of self-learning thoroughly. I learned Rails and ReactJS in a short period of time and was able to apply them into multiple projects. I gained great feedback from my peers for having a clear understanding of the concepts and was able to explain my work. 

#### Team-player 

I possess a strong commitment to team environment dynamics with the ability to make a contribution. As a tester, it was an essential task for me to deliver the users' requirements to the developers precisely. As a developer, I communicate with my team effectively during the development process and aim to deliver high quality works either as a follower or a leader.
